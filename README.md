Personal badass workflow

Using the power of Marionette but replace views by Ractive that add 2-way data-binding and a nicier (to me) templating system. Plus security of kouto-swiss and an cool grid system css driven (jeet).
And... the *lazy coding way* with the combo : jade coffee stylus.

---
some of the features provided :

+ HTML5 Boilerplate
+ jQuery
+ Backbone.js
+ Marionette.js
+ Underscore.js
+ Handlebars.js
+ RequireJS
+ Twitter Bootstrap
+ Express
+ yeoman (npm, bower, grunt)

---
plus soon :

+ stylus (jeet, kouto-swiss)
+ coffee-script
+ Ractive.js (with backbone-adaptor and some easings etc)
+ TweenMax.js
+ Jade ?

and no more :

+ Twitter Bootstrap
+ Handlebars.js ?



## Warning
This is actualy work in progress... I don't event install stylus yet...

## Developpement
@todo...
